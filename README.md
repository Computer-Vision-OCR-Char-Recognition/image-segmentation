# Image segmentation

Image segmentation web service designed for hosting on Heroku.

The API is inspired by [imgix](http://imgix.com) - you pass in the image url (optionally urlencoded),  control the algorithm with query parameters, and recieve a segmented image as the response (or a JSON formatted error). This allows you to embed it in a web page, or play with the algorithm in your browser without having to install any software.

```bash
https://segment-image.herokuapp.com/<image_url>?cluster_method=kmeans&num_clusters=10
```

The image above on the right is generated by the following URL (open it in your browser and try changing the parameters!):

```

```

The service supports the following parameters:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| `cluster_method` | `ward`, `meanshift` or `kmeans` |
| `colour_space` | `rgb`, `hsv`, `hls`, `ycrcb`, `lab` or `luv` |
| `num_clusters` | integer between 1 and 100, e.g. 5 (required with ward and kmeans) |
| `quantile` | a float between 0 and 1, e.g. 0.01 (required with meanshift) |

Ward is interesting, because it's configured with connectivity constraints - it'll cluster colours together by region. It's also the slowest algorithm, so may timeout (after ~25 seconds).

### Notes

Configure Redis to evict the less recently used keys first:

```
heroku plugins:install heroku-redis
heroku redis:maxmemory --policy allkeys-lru
```
